# WORKBOX

- Tool by Google for automatic service worker management
- Can use it with Gulp/Webpack various project setups or just the cli with straight scripts
- [DOCS](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli)

## Setup

- Install as a dev dependency: `npm install --save-dev workbox-cli` for v2
  - v3 is the latest as of this date
- write an npm script in `package.json` to use it to generate a service worker:
  - `"generate-sw": "workbox wizard && workbox generateSW workbox-config.js"`
    - This will analyze your files and automatically generate a config file to cache them (you can change this config file to tweak caching later)
    - \*\*\* Note: File name must be matched. If you had changedworkbox-config.js" to something else, please replace with your file name.
    - You can setup scripts for various workbox actions as follows:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
        // ...,
        "injectManifest": "workbox injectManifest workbox-config.js",
        "generate-sw": "workbox generateSW workbox-config.js",
        "wb-init": "workbox wizard && workbox generateSW workbox-config.js"
      },
    ```
  - run the script for `workbox wizard && workbox generateSW workbox-config.js`
    - choose the root of the web app when prompted (where index.html is served)
    - Follow prompts (can store everything to start with)
    - Troubleshooting: if you get a require error on generating the config file, **do not enter** `Y` to the later prompts, just press `enter` to save config when prompted.
- Where you register your service worker and point to the file, make sure the path points to the generated sw you made with the workbox-cli:

```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.register("/service-worker.js");
```

### Workbox basic config file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  globDirectory: "public/", // where do files to cache live
  globPatterns: [
    "**/*.{html,ico,json,css,png,jpg,js}", // any folder in public, any file name with any of these extensions should get cached.  Paths here are relative to the globDirectory defined above
  ],
  // *** DO NOT USE swSrc if running generateSW...only needed for injectManifest
  swSrc: "public/sw-base.js", // file to build upon and use for url routing /precaching with injectManifest - see Routing/Dynamic caching section below
  swDest: "public/service-worker.js", // where is the service worker file
  globIgnores: ["../workbox-config.js", "help/**"], // do not cache these files
};
```

(After changing this config anytime, run `workbox generateSW workbox-config.js` or make a script for it)

## Features

- Will automatically update the version if you run the generate command with Workbox-cli for development
- Puts all files specified in the config into the cache on install

## Development

- When you make changes to the service-worker or config file, run the script that runs `workbox generateSW workbox-config.js` (make an npm script for it)
  - generates a new service worker and overwrites the old one
- **If you are using injectManifest**: Run the injectManifest script every time you make changes to your base sw file, not the generateSW script above:
  - `workbox injectManifest workbox-config.js`
- After this, `Application -> clear storage -> Clear site data` in dev tools and reload the tab twice

## Routing / Dynamic Caching with Workbox

### injectManifest

- use [`injectManifest`](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli#injectmanifest) to cache the response for certain defined urls to which requests are sent (i.e. CDN requests for css or font files, etc.)
- You can build on an input service worker file that you create separate from the main service-worker.js file to help manage this (the service-worker.js file will be overwritten every time it is generated.)
- You can take the fileManifest array from the generated `service-worker.js` file and inject it into a new file you specify, i.e. `sw-base.js` or something like that
- Note `injectManifest` can also be used for pre-caching purposes

### Using injectManifest:

- Create a script to replace your original `generate-sw` npm script in package.json:
  - `"generate-sw": "workbox injectManifest workbox-config.js"`
    - the last part is the path to your config file generated by workbox
    - You may need to run the script `workbox wizard && workbox generateSW workbox-config.js` if you don't already have the generated files.
- Update your workbox-config.js file to set a `swSrc` to the file you want to build on and inject urls to precache into:

  - `swSrc: "public/sw-base.js",`
  - run the injectManifest script to generate a new service-worker.js

- Your `sw-base.js` file is what you edit and do work in. Workbox will use it to build on and generate a new `service-worker.js`
- In your `sw-base.js` file you can use the CDN workbox library to dynamically cache routes for things such as google fonts, CDN requests, etc.
  - using a `staleWhileRevalidate` strategy will check the cache for the asset and also fetch the resource and use or update the cache with it. (cache then network strategy)

Example `sw-base.js` file:

```javascript
// import the library for the version of workbox you are using
importScripts(
  "https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/5.1.4/workbox-sw.js"
);

workbox.setConfig({
  debug: true, // may not be needed or only during development - see console log statements
});

// Use the imported Workbox libraries to dynamically cache route responses:
const { registerRoute } = workbox.routing;
const { NetworkFirst, StaleWhileRevalidate } = workbox.strategies;

/**
 * NOTE: The order you register routes in matters (like a Switch Router)
 * - More specific routes need to come BEFORE more general route matches
 *    - for instance the post images cache route needs to come first because it includes googleapis which
 *      would have been caught by the latter google font route since it is more general and captures that
 *   (the post images cache would not be created)
 */

// make sure firebase stored images from posts don't go into the google api fonts cache above
registerRoute(
  /.*(?:firebasestorage\.googleapis)\.com.*$/,
  new StaleWhileRevalidate({ cacheName: "post-images" })
);

// Dynamic caching/routing for google fonts - use the reg exp to capture all requests in index.html to google apis for font loading and cache the response
registerRoute(
  /.*(?:googleapis|gstatic)\.com.*$/,
  new StaleWhileRevalidate({ cacheName: "google-fonts" }) // this reaches out to the cache to get the resource, but also makes a request which if successful, will replace the cached item with the updated resource -
);

// Dynamically cache Material-Design lite css CDN assets:
// note: you can pass in @variablename syntax to the express url in the first arg if needed using express syntax
registerRoute(
  "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/material-design-lite/1.3.0/material.indigo-pink.min.css",
  new StaleWhileRevalidate({ cacheName: "material-css" })
);

workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute(self.__WB_MANIFEST);
```

## Strategies

- See [DOCS](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-strategies) for updated configuration options
- You can use a number of caching strategies that the `workbox.strategies` library provides:

  - `CacheFirst`: Check the cache, then fallback to network if not found.
  - `CacheOnly`: Just look at the cache
  - `NetworkFirst`: Check the network first and go to cache if network fails
  - `NetworkOnly`: only check the network
  - `StaleWhileRevalidate`: Cache, then Network (always check the network, not just fallback)

- You can pass in configuration to these strategies

  - `cacheName`
  - Plugins: see docs and file example:

    - [`ExpirationPlugin`: { `maxEntries`, `maxAgeSeconds` }](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-expiration): Limit the number of assets stored in that cache and fetch updated versions if the max age has expired
    - [Broadcast Cache Update plugin: not used often](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-broadcast-update)
    - [Cacheable Response:](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-cacheable-response) Can cache responses based on status codes, headers etc.
    - [Background Sync Plugin](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-background-sync)
    - [Range Requests Plugin](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-range-requests)

    Ex:

    ```javascript
    registerRoute(
      /.*(?:googleapis|gstatic)\.com.*$/,
      new StaleWhileRevalidate({
        cacheName: "google-fonts",
        plugins: [
          // this sets a timestamp entry in indexedDB for the assets which it manages and checks to automatically remove when expiration comes
          new ExpirationPlugin({
            maxEntries: 3, // we only have 3 fonts we're using, don't store more
            maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24 * 30, // not necessarily with staleWhileRevalidate, but done here for example
          }),
        ],
      })
    );
    ```

### Custom Strategies

- Make a custom handler for a route with a custom caching strategy you define outside of what Workbox provides. You still take advantage of Workbox routing management.
  - There may not be an indexedDB strategy for example.
- Pass a function to the second argument of `registerRoute` which takes `args` that is the request event (the `fetch` event) - this contains info about the request sent
  - Return a promise that yields a response
